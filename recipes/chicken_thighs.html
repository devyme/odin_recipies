    <h3>These easy baked chicken thighs require minimum preparation; I love this quick recipe because I'm a college student! Feel free to season the chicken with your favorite spices. I like to use cayenne powder and black pepper.</3>

    <h2>Ingredient:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Chicken thighs</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons onion flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190 degrees C (375 degrees F)</li>
        <li>Place chicken thighs in a baking dish; season both sides with garlic powder and onion flakes.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer poink at the bone and juices run clearm about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh, near the bone, should read 74 degrees C (165 degrees F).</li>
    </ol>
